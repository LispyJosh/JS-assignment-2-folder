    <div class="History">

        <p>Mobile games began gaining traction in the late 1990s with Nokia's inclusion of Snake on its 6110 model in 1997, which became wildly popular for its simple yet addictive gameplay. The early 2000s saw further developments with the introduction of Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME) and Qualcomm’s BREW platforms, allowing more complex games to be developed and distributed.</p>

        <p>The release of the Apple iPhone in 2007 marked a major turning point, with its advanced hardware and the launch of the App Store in 2008 providing a platform for a new wave of mobile games. Titles like Angry Birds and Candy Crush Saga popularized casual gaming and the freemium model.</p>

Today, mobile games are a major force in the gaming industry, with billions of users worldwide and a significant share of gaming revenue.</p>
        
        <p>Advances in technology, including 5G and powerful mobile processors, have enabled more sophisticated and immersive gaming experiences on mobile devices, rivaling those of consoles and PCs.</p>
